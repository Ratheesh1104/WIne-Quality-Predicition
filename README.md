# Wine Quality Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various physicochemical attributes using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this study consists of red and white wine samples with quality ratings ranging from 0 to 10.

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset contains features such as acidity, alcohol content, density, pH, and more.
- The target variable is the wine quality score, which is an integer ranging from 0 to 10.
- Available on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality).

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data processing and modeling
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data handling and manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning algorithms
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for coding

## 🏗️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature selection, and normalization.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding feature relationships and distributions.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features for better predictions.
4. **Model Training**: Implementing multiple ML models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Comparing models based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model performance.

## 📊 Results
- Achieved **78% accuracy** with the best-performing model.
- Identified key features influencing wine quality.
- Provided insights on improving wine production based on chemical properties.
